refamiliarizing myself with github after many years away

I started programming in 1980 I suppose in large part thanks to a fellow classmate of mine who did a "convincing-type-speech" on getting into programming, not being "afraid" or turned-off from computers. TRS-80, Apple IIe, by 10th or 11th grade my science teacher asked me to do a grading program for him - average, standard-deviation, etc.

Im trying to remember the adventure-type game that I played on the IIe, I believe it would let you pick-up and use certain items to help you in your quest,very fun game, should be relatively easy to look up as not many text-based, adventure games were available
